# Girl Powerd Friday
### What is a Girl Powerd Friday?

Girls Powered Friday has been an exciting initiative led by our BRB Robotics Team. Through this program, we've been sharing our passion for STEM with younger girls in our community. Our team members stepped into mentoring roles, leading various hands-on activities that introduce students to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics.

During our sessions, we've guided participants through:

STEM-focused projects
Robot demonstrations
Engineering challenges
Technology exploration activities
Team-building exercises
As student mentors, we've had the opportunity to share our robotics team experience while helping younger students discover the excitement of STEM. Our team members have developed leadership skills while teaching, and it's been rewarding to see younger students gain confidence in their technical abilities.

The program demonstrates our BRB Robotics Team's commitment to spreading STEM education and supporting future innovators in our community.
